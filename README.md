# 06 Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

# Description
This challenge involves in creating a search option that provides weather conditions for cities inputted. It will create a history of the cities in a list on the left side and as the user searches for more cities, they will be added to the list. The user is able to click cities that appear on the list to switch between them. If user inputs an invalid city, it will prompt an alert, so user can try again.
